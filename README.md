As The Phoenix Rises (ATPR) uses real-time data to represent the rise of the OP Collective Phoenix through a generative & dynamic NFT. Every single day, the NFT updates using the overall contribution by chains in the superchain (Optimism, Base, Zora, Etc...) to the OP Collective, measured in ETH. As this number grows closer to 42,000 ETH / year, the Spheres become more and more in sync, and the red outline of the Phoenix becomes more visible. 

The Spheres represent the individual players in the OP Collective. The OP Collective is an experiment in human incentives and coordination. At the start of this real-world journey, the spheres are chaotic. They are moving at different speeds and different orbits. As the daily Collective Contribution rises, these spheres become more and more coordinated, the orbits move towards the same speed and path.

The red ring represents the Phoenix. At this start, it is not even visible in the NFT, but over the days as we have a larger and larger daily contribution to the collective, the dream of Ether's Phoenix becomes more real, and so does its representation in the NFT.

Once the OP Collective is generating more than 42,000 ETH / year, spheres are perfectly aligned around the Phoenix, which has reached its final form.
